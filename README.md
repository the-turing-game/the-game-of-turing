# The game of Turing
The definition of a general class of three player strategic games of deception and its discovery.
## Dramatis Personae
Here are the roles participating in the performance:
- X - _**deceptor**_, an entity or a machine that belongs to a class A, trying to convince interrogator that (s)he/it belongs to a class B;
- Y - _**cooperator**_, an entity or a machine that belongs to a class B, trying to help interrogator in discovering the truth about the deceptor;
- Z - _**interrogator**_, an entity or a machine that belongs to a class C, trying to discover the real classification of the players X and Y.
## The initial state of knowledge
The initial state of the game before any communications:
- Z knows that X and Y belong to two different classes, A and B;
- Z knows that X or Y will be trying to deceive him that (s)he/it belongs to class B;
- Z knows that X or Y will be cooperating with him against Y or X respectively;
- X knows what class Y belongs to;
- Y knows what class X belongs to;
- X and Y do not know what class Z belongs to;
## How the game is played
The game is played as a sequence of questions and answers.<br>
The only entity that is allowed to ask questions is Z.<br>
The question is asked to X or Y and (s)he/it must answer.<br>
The other player can add a comment to the answer<br>
## How the game ends
The duration of a game can be limited or not, these types are named 'finite' and 'potentially infinite' games.<br>
The game ends at sole discretion of Z when Z pronounces his guess in the form:<br>
X is A, Y is B or X is B, Y is A.
## The assessment of the results
The results of an ensemble of plays are assessed as relative probability of correct and wrong decisions.
